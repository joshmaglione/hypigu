# HypIgu

**HypIgu** (**HYP**erplane **IGU**sa) is a [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) package that provides functions to compute the Igusa local zeta function associated with hyperplane arrangements. It further contains various constructions of hyperplane arrangements and functions to compute their flag Hilbert&ndash;Poincaré series and other zeta functions. 

## Install, Setup, and Update

The simplest way to install HypIgu in SageMath is by running 

```bash
$ sage --pip install hypigu
```

If you already have HypIgu installed via `pip`, then you can update it by running 

```bash
$ sage --pip install hypigu --upgrade
```

HypIgu source files can be downloaded here: [Latest version](https://github.com/joshmaglione/hypigu/releases/latest)

This package is compatible with SageMath version 9.6 and later and has no external dependencies. It may work just fine with earlier versions of SageMath, but these have not been tested.
