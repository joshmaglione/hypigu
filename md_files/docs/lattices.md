# Lattices

We include a class called `LatticeOfFlats`, which is associated with a hyperplane arrangement. This class keeps track of basic information we need to compute the various generating functions associated with a hyperplane arrangement. (For non-central arrangements, this is indeed not a lattice, but a semi-lattice.) All other functions are tied to the `LatticeOfFlats` class and, thus, are either [attributes](#attributes) or methods. Methods are written as `.method_name`.

## LatticeOfFlats

**Input**:

- `A=None` : a hyperplane arrangement;
- `poset=None` : a graded poset with a bottom element;
- `flat_labels=None` : a dictionary from the elements of the poset to subsets of atoms;
- `hyperplane_labels=None` : a dictionary from the atoms of the poset to the hyperplanes;
- `matroid=None` : a matroid. 

**Output**: 

- the lattice of flats for the given hyperplane arrangement or matroid. If a poset is given, then the poset is returned. 

Despite the name "lattice of flats" the underlying poset need not be a lattice. 

Unless the poset and labels have been computed before, they should not be given as this function may compute the intersection poset of a hyperplane arrangement faster than the default in SageMath. It is not required to provide a hyperplane arrangement; in particular, one may instead only provide a matroid. 

### Attributes 

The lattice of flats has four attributes:

- `hyperplane_arrangement` : the given hyperplane arrangement;
- `poset` : the intersection poset;
- `flat_labels` : the dictionary indexed by the elements of `poset` with values given by subsets of the atoms of `poset`;
- `hyperplane_labels` : the dictionary indexed by the atoms of `poset` with values equal to the hyperplanes of `hyperplane_arrangement`.

#### Example (Lattice of braid arrangement)

We construct the lattice of flats for the braid arrangement in $\mathbb{R}^4$.

```python
sage: A = hi.CoxeterArrangement("A3")
sage: A
Arrangement of 6 hyperplanes of dimension 4 and rank 3
sage: L = hi.LatticeOfFlats(A)
sage: L
The lattice of flats of:
Arrangement of 6 hyperplanes of dimension 4 and rank 3
given by:
Finite poset containing 15 elements
```

Now we look at the data stored in the attributes. We display the hyperplanes in the arrangement.

```python
sage: L.hyperplane_arrangement
Arrangement of 6 hyperplanes of dimension 4 and rank 3
sage: L.hyperplane_arrangement.hyperplanes()
(Hyperplane 0*x0 + 0*x1 + x2 - x3 + 0,
 Hyperplane 0*x0 + x1 - x2 + 0*x3 + 0,
 Hyperplane 0*x0 + x1 + 0*x2 - x3 + 0,
 Hyperplane x0 - x1 + 0*x2 + 0*x3 + 0,
 Hyperplane x0 + 0*x1 - x2 + 0*x3 + 0,
 Hyperplane x0 + 0*x1 + 0*x2 - x3 + 0)
```

We display the poset as an image.

```python
sage: L.poset
Finite poset containing 15 elements
```

Instead of showing the entire dictionaries, we will evaluate them at a few points.

```python
sage: L.flat_labels[3]
{3}
sage: L.flat_labels[13]
{3, 5}
sage: L.flat_labels[9]
{1, 5, 6}
sage: L.flat_labels[0]
{}
```

We see that hyperplanes 1, 5, and 6 intersect in a codimension 2 subspace. 

```python
sage: L.hyperplane_labels[1]
Hyperplane 0*x0 + 0*x1 + x2 - x3 + 0
sage: L.hyperplane_labels[5]
Hyperplane x0 + 0*x1 - x2 + 0*x3 + 0
sage: L.hyperplane_labels[6]
Hyperplane x0 + 0*x1 + 0*x2 - x3 + 0
```

## .atoms

**Output**:

- the atoms of the underlying poset. 

## .deletion

**Input**:

- a hyperplane $H$.

**Output**:

- the lattice of flats associated to the arrangement without $H$.

#### Example (Deletion in the braid arrangement)

We continue the $\mathsf{A}_3$ example started [above](#example-lattice-of-braid-arrangement). We will delete the hyperplane labeled by $2$ and display the resulting lattice of flats. 

```python
sage: L.deletion(2)
The lattice of flats of:
Arrangement of 5 hyperplanes of dimension 4 and rank 3
given by:
Finite poset containing 13 elements
```

## .labels_of_flats

**Output**:

- the list of tuples with first entry an element of the poset and second entry a subset of atoms. 

## .labels_of_hyperplanes

**Output**:

- the list of tuples with first entry an element of the poset and second entry a hyperplane. 

## .Poincare_polynomial

**Output**:

- the Poincar&#233; polynomial of the hyperplane arrangement. 

## .proper_part_poset

**Output**:

- the subposet without $\hat{0}$ and $\hat{1}$.

## .show

No output given. This displays the underlying intersection poset using the default options in SageMath. This is a shortcut for `L.poset.show()`. 

## .subarrangement 

**Input**:

- an integer $x$.

**Output**:

- the lattice of flats of the interval $[\hat{0}, x]$. 

#### Example (Subarrangement of the braid arrangement)

We continue from the original $\mathsf{A}_3$ example started [above](#example-lattice-of-braid-arrangement). We will construct the subarrangement from the flat labeled $10$.

```python 
sage: L.subarrangement(10)
The lattice of flats of:
Arrangement <x1 - x2 | x0 - x1 | x0 - x2>
given by:
Finite poset containing 5 elements
```

## .restriction

**Input**:

- an integer $x$.

**Output**:

- the lattice of flats of the restriction to $x$ in the poset.

#### Example (Subarrangement of the braid arrangement)

We continue from the original $\mathsf{A}_3$ example started [above](#example-lattice-of-braid-arrangement). We will construct the restriction from the flat labeled $3$.

```python 
sage: L.restriction(3)
The lattice of flats of:
Arrangement <-x0 + x1 | x1 | x0>
given by:
Finite poset containing 5 elements
```
